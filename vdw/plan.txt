Suppose we have some VDW(k,c=2) number W.
By definition, any 2-coloring of the first W integers has a k-AP.
Look at the first W+1 numbers.
It has 1...W as a subset, so it too must have a k-AP.
Inductively, this means *THM-1*: any 2-coloring of n >= W has a k-AP.

Suppose we have some GW(k) number G.
By definition, perfect plays yield a k-AP on a board size of G.

Let w = VDW(k-1,c=2)
*Question: is G >= w?
If true, then by THM-1, the first w numbers of G must have a (k-1)AP

PRUNING GAMES
*Question: Does playing perfectly on any n > G yield a k-AP as well?
If true, then player 1 will win all games on board(n) for n from G to W

Well, it is known G <= W.
If G = W, then any n > G has a k-AP by THM-1 (don't even have to be perfect!)
Otherwise, assume some smallest n without a k-AP where G < n < W.

PRUNING A GAME
*Question: Is there n for which player 1 will win board(n) by choosing 1 first?
(Due to symmetry, the question is the same for starting at n)
If false, the computer can stop the running of alphabeta when player1 chooses 1 first (we know, by contrapositive, player1 will draw)

Assume there is
(Also assume player 1 is R, player 2 is B)
The k-AP cant be in [2,n] because it would belong to B (player 1 in board(n-1))
So the k-AP must include the Red 1.
For a given separation d, the rightmost member of that k-AP is at (k-1)*d.
There are a certain number of possible d's, determined by n and k
d ranges from 1 (RRR...) to n/(k-1) (floor or ciel, I can't tell)
When k > 2 (always for our programs) this set of integers is a fraction of n
We know GW(k=3), so k > 3. The fraction is smaller than n/2.
So B, who has floor(n / 2) moves, is able to block all k-APs R can make.
Contradiction!
